# About myself 
SP stands for "Simple Project". I am learning to code video games and should recreate simple games to train myself.  
I am all by myself and I want to share my progress here in Github.  
And so, THIS is a simple game of Pong. Feel free to give your opinion and do whatever you want with it.
