# SP-Pong : A simple Pong game
It's a simple two player Pong game. It was made for training, it isn't perfect.

# How to play
Player one (left player) :
- **W** to go up (might be Z for up because of my keyboard)
- **S** to go down

Player two (right player) :  
- **UpArrow** to go up  
- **LeftArrow** to go down

General Command :  
- Press **R** to restart the whole game  
- Press **Space** to launch the ball at the start  

# About myself 
SP stands for "Simple Project". I am learning to code video games and should recreate simple games to train myself.  
I am all by myself and I want to share my progress here in Github.  
And so, THIS is a simple game of Pong. Feel free to give your opinion and do whatever you want with it.
